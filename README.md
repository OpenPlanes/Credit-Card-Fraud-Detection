Utilizing ML Techniques to identify Credit Card Fraud
Worldwide financial losses caused by credit card fraudulent activities are worth tens of billions of dollars. One American over ten has been a victim of credit card fraud (median amount of $399), according to the Statistic Brain Research Institute [Ins18]. According to the latest European Central Bank (ECB) report , the total level of card fraud losses amounted to â‚¬1.8 billion in 2018 in the Single European Payment Area (SEPA).

There exists a wide variety of scenarios that may lead a fraudster to successfully perform fraudulent payments with a credit card. There is currently no definite taxonomy on credit card fraud types, though certain patterns are known to occur more frequently than others. It should also be noted that fraud detection is a cat and mouse game, where fraudulent patterns change over time. As technology evolves, both in terms of fraud prevention and ease of use of payment systems, so do fraudster techniques. They adapt by moving from the old (and by now fixed) targets to the vulnerability of the new technologies. They also benefit from the constant changes in volume and characteristics of genuine transactions.

Credit card fraud detection (CCFD) is like looking for needles in a haystack. It requires finding, out of millions of daily transactions, which ones are fraudulent. Due to the ever-increasing amount of data, it is now almost impossible for a human specialist to detect meaningful patterns from transaction data. For this reason, the use of machine learning techniques is now widespread in the field of fraud detection, where information extraction from large datasets is required.

Machine Learning (ML) is the study of algorithms that improve automatically through experience. ML is closely related to the fields of Statistics, Pattern Recognition, and Data Mining. At the same time, it emerges as a subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence and gives special attention to the algorithmic part of the knowledge extraction process. ML plays a key role in many scientific disciplines and its applications are part of our daily life. It is used for example to filter spam email, for weather prediction, in medical diagnosis, product recommendation, face detection, fraud detection.

**Context**

It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
